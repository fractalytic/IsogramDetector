# IsogramDetector

Simple program created for a SoloLearn Code Challenge that will take an input of a single word and will check if the word is an isogram
(a word in which no letter appears more than once)

At the moment this is limited to a c++ console program although if I get time will include a few versions in other languages

This has some basic error checking so that it can detect incorrect input such as multiple words (inclusion of a space), numbers and punctuation

A small timing routine is also included so that a comparison can be made if I write other versions
